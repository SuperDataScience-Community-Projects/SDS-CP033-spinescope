# 📄 SpineScope – Project Report - 🔴 **Advanced Track**

Welcome to your personal project report!  
Use this file to answer the key reflection questions for each phase of the project. This report is designed to help you think like a data scientist, guide AI tools more effectively, and prepare for real-world job interviews.

## ✅ Phase 1: Setup & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

> Answer the EDA questions provided in the project materials here. Focus on data quality, trends, anomalies, and relationships.

### 🔑 Question 1: What roles or experience levels yield the highest average salary?

### 🔑 Question 2: Does remote work correlate with higher or lower salaries?

### 🔑 Question 3: Are there differences in salary based on company size or location?

### 🔑 Question 4: How consistent are salaries across similar job titles?

---

## ✅ Phase 2: Model Development

> This phase spans 3 weeks. Answer each set of questions weekly as you build, train, evaluate, and improve your models.

### 📆 Week 1: Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing

#### 🔑 Question 1:
**Which categorical features are high-cardinality, and how will you encode them for use with embedding layers?**  

💡 **Hint:**  
Use `.nunique()` and `.value_counts()` to inspect cardinality.  
Use `LabelEncoder` or map categories to integer IDs.  
Think about issues like rare categories, overfitting, and embedding size selection.

#### 🔑 Question 1:
**Which biomechanical features are likely to have the most predictive power for classifying spinal conditions, and how did you determine that?**

💡 **Hint:**  
Use `.groupby(target).mean()`, boxplots, or violin plots to see how each feature separates across classes.  
Use correlation matrices or feature importance from an early tree-based model as a sanity check.  
Look for features that consistently differ between classes (e.g., high pelvic tilt in abnormal cases).

#### 🔑 Question 2:
**What numerical features in the dataset needed to be scaled before being input into a neural network, and what scaling method did you choose?**

💡 **Hint:**  
Use `df.describe()` and histograms to evaluate spread and skew.  
Neural networks are sensitive to feature scale.  
Choose between `StandardScaler`, `MinMaxScaler`, or log-transform based on distribution and range.

#### 🔑 Question 3:
**Did you create any new features based on domain knowledge or feature interactions? If yes, what are they and why might they help the model better predict spinal conditions?**

💡 **Hint:**  
Try combining related anatomical angles or calculating ratios/differences (e.g., `pelvic_incidence - sacral_slope`).  
Think: which combinations might reflect spinal misalignment patterns?

#### 🔑 Question 4:
**Which features, if any, did you choose to drop or simplify before modeling, and what was your justification?**

💡 **Hint:**  
Check for highly correlated or constant features using `.corr()` and `.nunique()`.  
Avoid overfitting by removing redundant signals.  
Be cautious about leaking target-related info if any engineered features are overly specific.

#### 🔑 Question 5:
**After preprocessing, what does your final input schema look like (i.e., how many numerical and categorical features)? Are there class imbalance or sparsity issues to be aware of?**

💡 **Hint:**  
Use `.shape`, `.dtypes`, and `.value_counts()` on the target.  
Check if certain features have many near-zero or rare values.  
Look for imbalanced class distributions and think about resampling, class weights, or focal loss.
